# TUDNET (The User Decides NETwork app) #

The goal of TUDNET is to be a censorship-resistant network communications app. The “TUD” in “TUDNET” stands for “The User Decides”.  It means that the decisions about what content is produced, published, and consumed on TUDNET will be made by the user, not by third parties with different interests.  At least, that is the  goal.

To achieve this goal and to achieve wide adoption, this project will attempt to:
* Use all available means to DECENTRALIZE all app operations.
* Make the app so easy to use that your computer-phobic elderly grandmother will want to use it.

TUDNET draws technical inspiration and ideas from the following:
  * Overlay Networks
  * Peer-To-Peer (P2P) architecture
  * Hierarchical data structures such as
    * Trees
    * Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs)
  * Distributed Hash Tables (DHTs)
  * Prefix Hash Trees (PHTs)
  * Git
  * Bitcoin and other blockchain systems
  * Freenet
  * InterPlanetary Filesystem (IPFS)  
  * Secure Quick Reliable Login (SQRL)
  * Faceted Search
  * Java and JavaFX
