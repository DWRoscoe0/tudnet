      Publishing Tools
      
      [ These are applications for the creation and publishing
      Infogora files, including documents, images, audios, and videos. 
      
      These tools also simultaneously create and publish 
      appropriate Index Entries for those files.
      This is the invisible half of the Infogora search engine. ]
      .
      Streaming Tools
      
      [ These are applications for generating Infogora streams.
      
      A stream is a special type of publication.
      What makes a stream special is that instead of 
      being delivered in one chunk after being created,
      a stream is delivered while it is being created,
      and often over an extended period of time.

      Streaming is especially useful for reporting live events.

      We usually think of streams as being audios and videos,
      but in theory any publication can be streamed,
      including text documents and sets of images. ]
      .
      Search App
      
      [ This is the visible half of the distributed search engine.
      It looks like a typical Internet search engine.
      
      It searches the Infogora Index for words the user types
      to find publications which contain those words.

      It can also setup searches that run in the background,
      looking for new publications as they become available.

      The other invisible half of the distributed search engine 
      is in the Publishing Tools which automaticly publish
      Index Entries when users create publications. ]
      .
      Subscription and Search Management
      
      [ This is for managing the lists of publications 
      to which you are subscribed, and all of your
      persistant/background searches.
      
      These are all the things that interest you
      that the Infogora is monitoring for you, 
      looking for new publications or changes in old ones.

      .
      Messaging

      [ Internet messaging includes things like 
      e-mail, Instant Messaging, Twitter, Web forums, 
      text chat rooms, and USENET. 
      
      The Infogora will provide functionally similar messaging,
      but to limit spam it will be done using the same 
      Publish-Subscribe metaphor used for other publications. ]
