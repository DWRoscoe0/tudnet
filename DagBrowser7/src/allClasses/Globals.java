package allClasses;

public class Globals 
  /* This class was used for convenient access to
    things the app needed to access from many different source files. 

    It was used as the argument for "import static" to reduce
    the need for fully qualified names, for example:
      import static allClasses.Globals.*;  // For appLogger;

    Often methods started here, but are eventually moved to their own classes.

    Eventually the class Misc was used for temporary homes for new code.
    
    WARNING: Use of globals (public statics) should be minimized,
    global storage anyway.  Dependency Injection should be used instead.
    When globals are used, they should be for things which
    do not change the state of the program, such as logging.
    
    This file can and probably should be eliminated.
